# voronoi-diagram-animation

This project produces a Voronoi diagram using the p-norm and animates in real-time how the diagram evolves as the the parameter of the p-norm changes.

## Usage

An easy way to run this project is to add all of the files to a Visual Studio project that has been given proper access to the SFML animation library and run the project in Visual Studio.

## Animation

See the video file voronoi_animation.mp4 for a demonstratoin of the animation produced.
